## **1. Setting Up Redux Toolkit**

### **Installation**

Install the required packages:

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

### **Store Configuration with Redux Toolkit**

```javascript
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import accountReducer from "./features/accounts/AccountSlice";
import customerReducer from "./features/customers/CustomerSlice";

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    account: accountReducer,
    customer: customerReducer,
  },
  middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) =>
    getDefaultMiddleware({
      thunk: true, // Thunk middleware is enabled by default
    }),
  devTools: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development", // Enable DevTools in development
});

export default store;
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Reducers**: Combine multiple reducers into a single root reducer.
2. **Middleware**: `getDefaultMiddleware` includes `thunk` by default. Customize it if needed.
3. **DevTools**: Enabled only in development mode for debugging.

## **2. Redux Flow and Application Structure**

Understanding the Redux flow and how to structure your application is crucial for effective state management.

### Redux Flow

![Redux Flow Diagram](https://redux.js.org/assets/images/ReduxDataFlowDiagram-49fa8c3968371d9ef6f2a1486bd40a26.gif)

1. User interacts with the View (React components)
2. View dispatches Actions
3. Reducers process Actions and update the Store
4. Store notifies the View of state changes
5. View re-renders based on new state

### Typical Redux Application Structure

```
src/
├── features/
│   ├── feature1/
│   │   ├── Feature1Component.js
│   │   ├── feature1Slice.js
│   │   └── feature1Thunks.js
│   └── feature2/
│       ├── Feature2Component.js
│       ├── feature2Slice.js
│       └── feature2Thunks.js
├── app/
│   └── store.js
├── components/
│   └── SharedComponents.js
└── App.js
```

This structure organizes code by feature, promoting modularity and scalability.

## **3. Creating Slices with Redux Toolkit**

Redux Toolkit introduces `createSlice` to simplify reducer and action creation. Here's an example based on the `AccountSlice`:

```javascript
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const initialState = {
  balance: 0,
  loan: 0,
  loanPurpose: "",
  isLoading: false,
};

const accountSlice = createSlice({
  name: "account",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    deposit(state, action) {
      state.balance += action.payload;
      state.isLoading = false;
    },
    withdraw(state, action) {
      state.balance -= action.payload;
    },
    requestLoan: {
      prepare(loanAmount, loanPurpose) {
        return {
          payload: {
            loanAmount,
            loanPurpose,
          },
        };
      },
      reducer(state, action) {
        if (state.loan > 0) return;
        state.loan = action.payload.loanAmount;
        state.loanPurpose = action.payload.loanPurpose;
        state.balance += action.payload.loanAmount;
      },
    },
    payLoan(state) {
      state.balance -= state.loan;
      state.loanPurpose = "";
      state.loan = 0;
    },
    convertingCurrency(state) {
      state.isLoading = true;
    },
  },
});

export const { withdraw, requestLoan, payLoan } = accountSlice.actions;
export default accountSlice.reducer;
```

### **Key Features:**

1. **Reducers and Actions**: Reducers and actions are defined in one place.
2. **Prepare Callback**: Used in `requestLoan` to preprocess the payload.

## **4. Using Thunks in Redux Toolkit**

### **Modern Way: `createAsyncThunk`**

`createAsyncThunk` simplifies handling async logic like API calls.

```javascript
import { createAsyncThunk, createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

export const fetchUser = createAsyncThunk("user/fetchUser", async () => {
  const response = await fetch("/api/user");
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
});

const userSlice = createSlice({
  name: "user",
  initialState: { data: null, status: "idle", error: null },
  reducers: {},
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder
      .addCase(fetchUser.pending, (state) => {
        state.status = "loading";
      })
      .addCase(fetchUser.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
        state.status = "succeeded";
        state.data = action.payload;
      })
      .addCase(fetchUser.rejected, (state, action) => {
        state.status = "failed";
        state.error = action.error.message;
      });
  },
});

export default userSlice.reducer;
```

### **Manual Thunks**

You can still write thunks manually if needed.

```javascript
export const deposit = (amount, currency) => {
  if (currency === "USD") return { type: "account/deposit", payload: amount };

  return async function (dispatch) {
    dispatch({ type: "account/convertingCurrency" });

    const res = await fetch(
      `https://api.frankfurter.dev/v1/latest?base=${currency}&symbols=USD`
    );
    const data = await res.json();
    const convertedAmount = amount * data.rates.USD;

    dispatch({ type: "account/deposit", payload: convertedAmount });
  };
};
```

---

## **5. The Old Way (Plain Redux)**

### **Setting Up the Reducer**

```javascript
const initialStateAccount = {
  balance: 0,
  loan: 0,
  loanPurpose: "",
  isLoading: false,
};

export default function accountReducer(state = initialStateAccount, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "account/convertingCurrency":
      return { ...state, isLoading: true };

    case "account/deposit":
      return {
        ...state,
        balance: state.balance + action.payload,
        isLoading: false,
      };

    case "account/withdraw":
      return {
        ...state,
        balance: state.balance - action.payload,
      };

    case "account/requestLoan":
      if (state.loan > 0) return state;
      return {
        ...state,
        loan: action.payload.amount,
        loanPurpose: action.payload.loanPurpose,
        balance: state.balance + action.payload.amount,
      };

    case "account/payLoan":
      return {
        ...state,
        loan: 0,
        loanPurpose: "",
        balance: state.balance - state.loan,
      };

    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

### **Creating Actions**

```javascript
export function deposit(amount, currency) {
  if (currency === "USD") return { type: "account/deposit", payload: amount };

  return async function (dispatch) {
    dispatch({ type: "account/convertingCurrency" });

    const res = await fetch(
      `https://api.frankfurter.dev/v1/latest?base=${currency}&symbols=USD`
    );
    const data = await res.json();
    const convertedAmount = amount * data.rates.USD;

    dispatch({ type: "account/deposit", payload: convertedAmount });
  };
}

export function withdraw(amount) {
  return { type: "account/withdraw", payload: amount };
}

export function requestLoan(amount, loanPurpose) {
  return {
    type: "account/requestLoan",
    payload: { amount: amount, loanPurpose: loanPurpose },
  };
}

export function payLoan() {
  return { type: "account/payLoan" };
}
```

## **6. Selectors and `useSelector`**

Selectors are used to access state efficiently. The `useSelector` hook from React-Redux allows components to extract data from the Redux store.

```javascript
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";

// Selector functions
export const getAccountBalance = (state) => state.account.balance;
export const getLoanDetails = (state) => ({
  loan: state.account.loan,
  loanPurpose: state.account.loanPurpose,
});

// Using selectors in a component
function AccountInfo() {
  const balance = useSelector(getAccountBalance);
  const { loan, loanPurpose } = useSelector(getLoanDetails);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Balance: ${balance}</p>
      <p>Loan: ${loan}</p>
      <p>Loan Purpose: {loanPurpose}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## **7. DOs and DON'Ts**

### **DOs:**

1. Use Redux Toolkit for better readability and maintainability.
2. Use `createSlice` and `createAsyncThunk` for modern Redux.
3. Normalize state for complex data.
4. Use selectors to encapsulate state access logic.

### **DON'Ts:**

1. Avoid deeply nested state for better performance.
2. Don't directly mutate state outside reducers.
3. Avoid overusing Redux for local component state.

---

## **8. Performance Considerations**

Optimizing Redux performance is crucial for maintaining a responsive application. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Use Reselect for Memoized Selectors**: Reselect can help prevent unnecessary re-renders by memoizing derived state.
